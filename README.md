# WhatsApp Web Dark Mode

<del>As of recently, WhatsApp Web has an official Dark Mode support that isn't shown yet. This Userscript makes it run by default.</del>

**WhatsApp now has a dark theme natively in WhatsApp Web, but it still falls back to the default theme sometimes because it has issues with saving this setting for some reason. That's why this script is still better. ;)**

## Installation

1. Get Greasemonkey support for your browser ([Tampermonkey usually does the trick](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en))

2. Go to the [raw version](https://github.com/tkore/WhatsApp-Web-dark-mode/raw/master/WhatsApp-Dark-Mode.user.js) of WhatsApp-Dark-Mode.user.js

3. Click install

4. Refresh your WhatsApp Web tab and go wild
