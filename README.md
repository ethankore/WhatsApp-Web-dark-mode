# WhatsApp Web Dark Mode

As of recently, WhatsApp Web has an official Dark Mode support that isn't shown yet. This Userscript makes it run by default :)

## Installation

1. Get Greasemonkey support for your browser ([Tampermonkey usually does the trick](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en))

2. Go to the [raw version](https://github.com/tkore/WhatsApp-Web-dark-mode/raw/master/WhatsApp-Dark-Mode.user.js) of WhatsApp-Dark-Mode.user.js

3. Click install

4. Refresh your WhatsApp Web tab and go wild
